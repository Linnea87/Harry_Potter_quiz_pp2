# Harry Potter quiz - Project 2

This is a quiz with 10 random questions about Harry Potter. The page can be found here [Harry Potter Quiz](https://linnea87.github.io/Harry_Potter_quiz_pp2/)

The purpose of this website is partly to create a simple quiz based game, where users get the opportunity to test their Harry Potter knowledge. But even where I get to challenge myself in my knowledge of Html, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Goals
* Create a game that attracts and inspires the user to want to stay and play.
* Create a game that is responsive on all devises.
* Create a game with no errors
* Create a game for the user to interact with.
* Create a game that is easy for the user to understand.
* Create a game with rulses for the user to read
* create a game where the user can see their scores.


## Design
I wanted to design a Harry Potter game that evokes the feeling of being part of Hogwarts and its magical world in the user. I have chosen colors, images, typograpy and mouse pointer in detail to succeed in creating this feeling for the user. 

### Wireframes
I used wierframes from Balsamiq for this page. These wireframes are rough sketches of how I thought the site could be built to achieve the design I envisioned. Therefore, these sketches may differ from what the actual website looks like.

### Typhograpy
I chose Henny Penny as the font style as I think it creates the magical feeling I want to achieve.

### The mouse pointer
I wanted the mouse pointer to be a magic wand when playing the game on a laptop or desktop. The cursor I chose is from this page [cursors-4u](https://www.cursors-4u.com). 

### Color
I used the <https://coolors.co> tool where I uploaded the background image to create a color scheme that I have since based on when making my color choices.

## Deployment
### Adding, committing and pushing code
* All code has been pushed to the repository [Harry_Potter_quize_pp2](https://github.com/Linnea87/Harry_Potter_quiz_pp2)
* All code has been regurlary added, committed and pushed throughout the project.
* The commands being used are `git add <file>`,
  `git commit -m “commit message”` and
  `git push`
* Due to being completely brand new into this tech world, the `git commit -m “commit message”` have gradually improved throughout this project since it was difficult for me to understand the importance of good logging in the beginning.

### GitHub Pages
1. I opened up the repository "Harry_Potter_quiz_pp2" on my profile.
2. I Clicked on 'Settings' and scrolled down to 'Pages'.
3. Then I selected the 'Main Branch' and waited for the page to reload.
4. The page was successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Code Validation
### HTML
[W3C - HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) validator shows no errors or warnings in the index.html file.

[Jshint](https://jshint.com/) shows no errors in script.js and questions.js.

* When script.js are tested, Jshint shows that on line 48 and 78 there are one undefined variable. This variable are defined in questions.js and therfore Jshint presents this information. The variable can be found on line 3 in questions.js.
