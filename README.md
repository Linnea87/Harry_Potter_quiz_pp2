# Harry Potter quiz - Project 2
## Design
### Wireframes
I used wierframes from Balsamiq for this page. These wireframes are just rough sketches of how I thought the page would look and therefore they may differ from how the finished page looks.

### Color
I used the <https://coolors.co> tool where I uploaded the background image to create a color scheme that I have since based on when making my color choices.

## Deployment
### Adding, committing and pushing code
* All code has been pushed to the repository https://github.com/Linnea87/Harry_Potter_quiz_pp2
* All code has been regurlary added, committed and pushed throughout the project.
* The commands being used are `git add <file>`,
  `git commit -m “commit message”` and
  `git push`
* Due to being completely brand new into this tech world, the `git commit -m “commit message”` have gradually improved throughout this project since it was difficult for me to understand the importance of good logging in the beginning.

### GitHub Pages
1. I opened up the repository "Harry_Potter_quiz_pp2" on my profile.
2. I Clicked on 'Settings' and scrolled down to 'Pages'.
3. Then I selected the 'Main Branch' and waited for the page to reload.
4. The page was successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.
